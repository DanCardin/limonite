[DanCardin](https://github.com/DanCardin) and I wanted to see if we could write a very basic language compiler in Rust. This is mostly for us to expand our knowledge of the new and exciting Rust programming language.

* At the moment we are looking into writing our own lexer and parser.
* LLVM compatability with Rust is being reasearched.
* Syntax is also being determined. See sample.lim for the most up to date examples.
